This is a solution to a [challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H) on Frontend Mentor.

### Learning reflections

#### What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?
I'm glad to complete my first challenge, while aware that it's very simple. I found it helpful to throw in the code from Figma dev mode and then figure out what exactly why that code was insufficient and how I needed to make it all work together. I used ChatGPT to help me understand particular lines of code, and help me figure out solutions. Hopefully that's a legitimate use of AI that won't sabotage my learning!

#### What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?
Didn't realise that the browser was adding default margin values that I needed to override.

Took me a while to realise that the Figma dev code was sometimes inappropriate (e.g. the width/height values of the highest-level frame are in the figma code, but shouldn't be in the real thing).

#### What specific areas of your project would you like help with?
I'd like help with figuring out the right learning approach for me. I'm interested in learning frontend code as a complement to my design skills — to better understand the developer perspective, and to potentially help me do some simple tasks myself. I'm not looking to become an expert developer. I'd particularly like to make better use of AI tools — i.e. create app frontends quickly using the optimal combination of design, AI, and coding skills.

Next time I'm considering using Figma MCP to create the solution, then systematically making sure I understand the code, and tweaking it to correct problems. That's ultimately the workflow I'm looking to follow in real life, but I'm not sure if it's good idea or not for a learning approach.

I'm also considering using Cursor rather than VS Code next time, for the same kind of reason
